He like waking and follow people except me. He also like to sleep on my bed. When he came home first time, he is quiet little cute puppy. However, a few days later, he is turning in to troublemaker. He ate all thing on the floor, and chew the wires. But still he is my cuttest puppy ever. He has one thing to scare which is vaccum cleaner. When I start to turn that on, he hide to shose shelf.</center></p>
